## Description
A traditional RESTful API calling application transformed into a MERN application. This project was converted from REST to  using GraphQl requests/mutations. For the backend, I used the GraphQL playground, then used @Apollo/client to implement the queries/mutations for the frontend. A lot of useful packages came in handy for this application; such as, apollo-client, concurrently, and jwt-token. Concurrently was very beneficial, because it allow two terminals to become one (the client and the server). These were all needed in transforming this project into a fully functional MERN application.
